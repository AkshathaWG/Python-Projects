2. Project - Optimization of Lot Sizing Problem for Injection Molding Machines at Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH (BMW)

-Explanation of the Dataset

The process studied occurs in two stages

i) Injection Molding

ii) Paint shop.

• There are 22 parts which are produced on 7 Injection Molding machines.

• Machines are assumed to produce only one part at a time and for the functioning of our problem we consider single working machines and not parallel working machines.

• Average set up costs for each machine is provided.

• The production process takes place in three shifts for Induction Molding namely i) Night shift ii) Early shift iii) Late shift

• Three shifts for for the Paint Shop namely i) Early Shift ii) Late Shift

• The night shift pays most at euro 50, while the early and late shift pay 35 euro and 40 euros respectively.

• The Injection Molding process and the Paint shop work takes place from Monday to Friday according to our data.

• The operational timings for the workshop are 6-15.30 hours for the early shift and 15.30-1.00 hour for the late shift.

3. Master Thesis - Electric Vehicle Purchasing Behaviour in Beijing, China

• The world is currently moving towards lessening the environmental footprint caused by the transportation sector and a major player for this are Electric Vehicles. China being one of the top countries who are tackling the issue of air pollution have been on a fast track to shift towards electric vehicles.

• A survey was conducted among 504 Beijing citizens in 2017 to understand what factors influence the decision maker in choosing an electric vehicle as opposed to that of a conventional vehicle.

• The survey also focuses on a 2011 policy introduced in Beijing, which promotes the purchase of electric vehicles by stating that the buyer will not have to go through the license plate lottery that applies to everyone else when purchasing a conventional vehicle.

• This thesis consists of a mixture of logit models with panel data which provides an insight on the influence of Socioeconomics and Demographics factors, Car specific attributes and Purchase decision behaviour of the decision maker.

• PythonBiogeme is used for the discrete choice modelling and the assessment is of the electric and hybrid vehicles rather than that of a conventional vehicle.

• Certain attributes like Employement, Age, Gender, Driving Range of a car, Recharge time for a car played significant rles in influencing the decision maker.

• 19 different hypothesis were tested to see influence of all the attributes.

• The developed model was further used to check the Elasticities.
